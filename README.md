## ðŸ§  Features

- **Feature extraction** using a pretrained CNN via `img2vec-pytorch`  
- **Training** a `RandomForestClassifier` on your custom dataset  
- **Inference** on new images with a saved model


## Included Dataset

The dataset is included in this repository under the `datasetfinal.zip` folder.
