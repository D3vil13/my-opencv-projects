# Hand Gesture Volume Controller (Logarithmic Scaling)

This is the fifth project in my 30-day Computer Vision challenge.

The application uses your webcam to detect hand gestures (thumb and index finger distance) to control your system volume. The volume scaling is implemented using a **logarithmic mapping** for more natural audio perception.
