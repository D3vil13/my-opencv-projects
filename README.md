## üîç Overview

This project captures live video from your webcam, converts each frame to HSV color space, applies a threshold for ‚Äúyellow‚Äù pixels, finds contours for every connected yellow region, and then:

1. Filters out small contours (noise) by area.
2. Draws a green bounding box around each detected yellow object.
3. Labels each bounding box with a count index (1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶).
4. Displays the current FPS in the top-left.
